              that I've used in a few projects.</p>

+1. Refactor plan slide. Probably, bullets will appear as I will be speaking.

+2. Speed up some slides to free up a bit of time.

~3. Add slide for data representations.

+4. Add cake pattern example slide.

+5. Rearrange data slide before shortcomings/benefits.

+6. And probably some other changes.

7. Add example - common thread
* speeding it up a touch which might make it easier to fit in some deeper explanation of things like the cake pattern, see below.

+* Plan slide: is there a way to either shrink down the list of bullets or fade them in. I find that audiences stop listening to you talk and will simply read slides like that.

~* Data representation neeeds slide:
Good explanation. I did notice that you showed some text right before the

+Short comings: Great slide and good explanation of the shortcomings.

+You mention the cake pattern but assume that people know what you are talking about. Not sure there is time to explain the whole thing but is there a way that you can make a quick explanation?

+Data example slide. Can you show this before you talk about the limitations of case classes and the benefits of typed ontology? This would give the audience an understanding of what each one looks like in practice.

This may be too big of a change at this point but so please disregard it if it is.
Would it be possible to put together an example that is the common thread that you use for the whole presentation?
This gives the audience a way to apply what you are saying to the problems they are trying to solve.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Various layers of application _ have different data representation _ needs. Very often some layers
            need to represent incomplete data. For instance, we may not have database identifiers at some point,
              or we may fill-in a form _ in a few steps. When we obtain data from external sources,
              we might encounter 'invalid values in certain properties.</p>
            <p>[NF] Another important use case is the event-driven architectures or CQRS. Events often contain very limited
            information about entities, like single property change, or _ collection element _ addition or removal.
              We may want to subscribe to changes of some of the properties.</p>
            <p>[NF] Many applications require associating runtime metainformation with properties. For example, we may want
              to know the description of a property, [O]alternative names, it's runtime type, UI-control hints. We may want to have some
              property constraints that can be checked in a few layers of application.</p>
            <p>[NF] As we may see, the needs differ _ in various layers of application _ and
              we may have to use different forms of data.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
              <p>Let's see _ how `case classes` work _ for the various data representation needs.</p>
              <p>For incomplete data representation we will often see different sets of case classes in
                  different layers and have to manually copy the data from one representation to another.
                  Another often seen solution is
                  to declare some of the fields as optional and check the presence of data every time we access the property.</p>
              <p>If we want to preserve the conversion error, then `Try` or [ˈaɪðə]`Either` might be used instead of the `Option`.</p>

              <p>[NF] For capturing events _ we have to implement _ a dedicated set of classes and
                  an associated special interpreter _ that will apply the events to data. There is almost no way
                  to reuse property names or types or create a versatile interpreter.
              </p>
              <p>[NF] To preserve metainformation along with the property _ we do have some mechanism in place.
                  We can access metainformation using annotations and reflection.
                  Unfortunately, it is very constrained and really not the first-class. For instance, we cannot
                  associate a type class instance with rich logic, nor we can use our classes with rich metainformation.</p>

            <p>The influence of ontology on architecture is tremendous</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Domain model is defined in a single place without any repetition.</li>
              <li>[NF] Ontology defines a unified domain language for the complete application.</li>
              <li>[NF] It makes it easy to implement meta programming (like code generation, macros, DSLs, and things like that)</li>
              <li>[NF] Database schema can also be inferred from the same domain model. It can easily evolve together with the domain model.</li>
              <li>[NF] Using ontology we can naturally implement event sourcing. We can focus on a particular changed property, on a subset of properties,
                or on a subschema of an entity. And we can record
              events in a unified way for any properties.</li>
              <li>[NF] Because all application layers speak the same domain language,
                the data is fully automatically transferred between application layers. There is no need to
              manually create error prone copying methods.</li>
              <li>[NF] One of the possible ways to define user interface is to associate additional metainformation with
              properties and generate UI through templates that are selected and parametrized by that metainformation.</li>
              <li>[NF] The last but not least _ is the ability _ to reuse the validation logic, defined in the ontology model,
                across the application.</li>

            <p>In conclusion I would like to encourage you to do an experiment with typed ontology and
